# Writeup for Ouija

## Description

```text
You've made contact with a spirit from beyond the grave! Unfortunately, they speak in an ancient tongue of flags, so you can't understand a word. You've enlisted a medium who can translate it, but they like to take their time...
```

A 64-bit elf with a minimal reversing.

## Flag

Opening the binary in binary ninja, we see a flag but encrypted. 

```text
00002020  char const flag[0x41] = "ZLT{Svvafy_kdwwhk_lg_qgmj_ugvw_escwk_al_wskq_lg_ghlaearw_dslwj!}", 0
```

Seems to be a ceaser cipher, decoding it we get the flag.
